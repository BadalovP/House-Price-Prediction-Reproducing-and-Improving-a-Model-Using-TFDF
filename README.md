# House Price Prediction: Reproducing and Improving a Model Using TFDF

This project reproduces and improves a machine learning model for predicting house prices, originally implemented in Python using TensorFlow Decision Forests. The R version applies equivalent models, compares results, and improves accuracy using alternative algorithms.
